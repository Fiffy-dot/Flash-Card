# Flash-Card
This is built using Tkinter
* These are flash cards that help you practice words in a different language, in this case it's German.
* In this case, the flash card shows a German word for 3 seconds and you either click the tick or not to indicate whether you got the English version right.
* Clicking either of the buttons displays a new card again
